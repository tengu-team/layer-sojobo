      list of extra apt sources, per charm-helpers standard
      format (a yaml list of strings encoded as a string). each source

  install_keys:
    description: |
      list of signing keys for install_sources package sources, per
      charmhelpers standard format (a yaml list of strings encoded as

      keyserver, operators should be aware that this mechanism is
      insecure. null can be used if a standard package signing key is
      used that will already be installed on the machine, and for ppa
      sources where the package signing key is securely retrieved from
      launchpad.
