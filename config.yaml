      The location where the api will search for local charms, when the app_name is prefixed with "local:<app_name>"
  host:
    type: string

    description: listen address. When left at the default value, defaults to internal ip address.
  install_sources:
    description: |
      list of extra apt sources, per charm-helpers standard
      format (a yaml list of strings encoded as a string). each source
      may be either a line that can be added directly to
      sources.list(5), or in the form ppa:<user>/<ppa-name> for adding
      personal package archives, or a distribution component to enable.

      - "ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6"
  install_keys:
    description: |
      list of signing keys for install_sources package sources, per
      charmhelpers standard format (a yaml list of strings encoded as
      a string). the keys should be the full ascii armoured gpg public
      keys. while gpg key ids are also supported and looked up on a
      keyserver, operators should be aware that this mechanism is
      insecure. null can be used if a standard package signing key is
      used that will already be installed on the machine, and for ppa
      sources where the package signing key is securely retrieved from
      launchpad.
